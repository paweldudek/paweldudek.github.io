      <description>BDD is about constant feedback. Constant feedback about the code you write. Constant feedback whether your last refactor broke something, or whether everything works as expected. Your tests are here to tell you whether everything is OK. The sooner you get that feedback the better. By receiving information about state of your system as soon as possible you keep your flow uninterrupted. You stay focused on the task that you&amp;rsquo;re currently trying to complete.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always perceived sharing knowledge as a way of giving back to the community for what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from it. That&amp;rsquo;s why I love speaking and sharing what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over the course of my career.</description>

      <description>Hey there! My name is Pawel and I’ve been tinkering with iOS since 2008 (or iPhone OS as it was called back then). I’ve started working on commercial projects in early 2009, when Xcode 3 and SDK 2.2 still rocked the world (and oh those where the times). Since then I’ve built numerous apps for both business and consumer markets. During those years of development the concept of code quality grew on me.</description>
